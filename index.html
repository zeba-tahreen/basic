                <img  class = "img" src="assets/images/me.jpg" alt="Zeba" > <p>Hello Everyone... Welcome to my Page... !!! 
                        I'm Zeba and I am based from India, I'm a fashion designer who is a great food lover
                        (kind of good cook as well) and always passionate to learn and upgrade myself with new knowledge.
                        Currently I'm working in Amazon as a "Associate", I have been with Amazon since more than
                        a year now and I love my work.</p>   
                     <p>I came in contact to programming a few years ago when I worked under a Programmer as an
                        "Content Curator and social media manager" for their website named "WedNeeds". I was very
                        curious to know what he is doing on that black screen (Terminal), because I was already learning
                        Fashion Designing and also I was told "Programming is needs years of computer science study" I
                        skipped it and move on with my passion of clothing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, In US when I saw that "Rutgers Bootcamps" are offering a "Full Stack Development" course
                        which doesn't require years of computer science study my becoming a programmer hope came to light.
                        I am all set for new education and challenges to make myself ready to step into the world of Tech
                        as "Full Stack Developer".
